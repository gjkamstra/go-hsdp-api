# This is a global registry for public HSDP services
# containing most static configuration. Its main purpose is to 
# reduce configuration parameters and drive automation of the 
# platform further by having a human and machine readable source of
# common configuration parameters
# 
# Before using it as your source of truth please confirm it has
# the expected values.
#
# Also it goes without saying, but we will say it anyway:
# It is your responsibilty to ensure correct configuration of 
# your deployments.
#
# If you spot errors or incomplete information please raise a 
# PR. Thanks!
#
# Definitions:
#
# Region - a geographical region where services are deployed
# Environment - a stage within a geographical region to aid in phased deployment 
# Service - a consumable software service
# Instance - a specific deployment of a service
#
# Hierarchy example:
#
# Earth
#   Region us-east
#     Service
#       cf
#     Environment client-test
#       Service
#         iam

# 
# Nesting syntax: [region.environment.service.instance]
#
# Services can be tied to a region or an environment
# We also anticipate global services at some point
# Example of a region bound service: Cloud foundry
# Example of a enivronment bound service: IAM
